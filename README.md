# ServiceNow Task Handler

The **ServiceNow Task Handler** is a Python script designed to automate the lifecycle of ServiceNow tasks. It continuously polls for new tasks, updates their status, processes them, and closes them outâ€”all while maintaining efficiency and ensuring no duplicate processing.

---

## Features

- **Retrieve Tasks**: Fetches open tasks from ServiceNow using the ServiceNow API.
- **Task Variables**: Extracts and processes task variables for fulfillment.
- **Status Updates**: Updates task status to "Work in Progress" to prevent duplicate handling.
- **Fulfillment Actions**: Executes task-specific logic for fulfillment (customizable per use case).
- **Closure**: Marks tasks as "Closed" upon successful completion.
